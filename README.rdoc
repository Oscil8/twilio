= Twilio Gem

The Twilio gem provides two major pieces of functionality: (1) a Ruby wrapper for the Twilio REST API and (2) response handlers based on the Twilio Markup XML (TwiML).

See http://www.twilio.com/docs/index for Twilio's API documentation.

For an overview of the Twilio Gem and a sample use case, check out http://www.webficient.com/2009/06/22/hello-this-is-your-rails-app-calling-you.

Sample Usage:

First create a connection object:

  c = Twilio::Connection.new('my_twilio_sid', 'my_auth_token')
  
Now instantiate other objects by passing in the connection:
  
  call = Twilio::Call.new(c)
  call.make('1234567890', '9876543210', 'http://mysite.com/connected_call')
  
  recording = Twilio::Recording.new(c)
  recording.list

When Twilio's servers ping your callback url, you can respond with the Twilio Verb object. For example,
in a Ruby on Rails application, you could do the following inside a controller class:

  verb = Twilio::Verb.new { |v|
    v.say("The time is #{Time.now}")
    v.hangup
  }
  verb.response
